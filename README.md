## IoT Based Water Quality Measuring System

The main objectives of the proposed system are:

1. To continuously measure and monitor the quality parameters of drinking water like pH, turbidity and temperature using sensors and NodeMCU.
2. To store the measured values in a cloud hosted NoSQL database (FIREBASE database) making use of IoT technology.
3. A robust and user-friendly mobile application is developed using scratch programming to display the parameter values from the database.
4. The user is alerted whenever the water quality goes below the standards. IFTTT framework is used to send an alerting voice message to the user by using VoIP calling. The message includes the parameter values and the time instance at which the breach has occurred.
